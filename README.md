# missing_char
When given a mostly consecutive array of letters it returns the letter that is missing. <br/>
For example in the array [a,b,c,e] it would return the letter d. <br/>
This program would be useful in checking to see if the user had skipped a number. <br/>
However it's fault lies in the first and last element in the array which go unchecked by this algorithm <br/>
